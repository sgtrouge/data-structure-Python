# data-structure-Python
Porting some fun &amp; neat algorithms related to DS and String from C++ like Fenwick tree and Z-function

# BITree
A dynamic data structure that support aggregation method, like finding sum of value in a range, finding the k-th element in a range, etc.. Only work with integer!

#TODO
Add support for negative integer! (can mimic symmetrically previous code)

#NEXT
String algorithms: Palindrome searching O(n), Z-function and KMP for string matching O(n), dictionary ordering with trie.
